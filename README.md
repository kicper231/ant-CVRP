# ant-CVRP

This project provides an implementation of the Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm for solving the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) in C#.
CVRP involves finding the most efficient delivery routes for a fleet of vehicles with limited capacity.
ACO is a metaheuristic inspired by the behavior of ants, using pheromone trails to iteratively improve routing solutions.
